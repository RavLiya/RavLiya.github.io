## Projects
### Implementing Braintenberg algorithm with Python (2022)
* The algorithm was implemented on a robot for obstacle avoidance and maze solving.
* Simulation was done on Coppeliasim and the Python API was run on Jupyter Notebook.

### Object identification and separation robot (2022)
* The robot travels randomly through the environment and identifies waste and plants and delivers them to their respective bins.
* Programmed using Python and simulated using Coppeliasim.

### Maze solver using Python (2022)
* A robot was programmed using python for maze solving using its sensor readings.
* Proximity sensors were used for sensing.

### Line follower with Python (2022)
* Two-wheeled robot was programmed to follow a line using an array of three line sensors.
* The robot has the ability to find the end of the line by deciding which direction to turn at junctions.

### Occupancy grid map development with SLAM (2022)
* Mapping each object by traveling through the environment and scanning using the SLAM toolkit in MATLAB.
* The robot was equipped with ray-type proximity sensors for obstacle detection and a LiDAR sensor for environment scanning.

### Mechatronics module project (2020 - 2021)
* Automation of workflow process using conveyor belts.
* The conveyor belt was designed using SOLIDWORKS.
* Program the conveyor belt process using Arduino and demonstrate of the program.
